This is a drawing application that allows the user to make scenes with shapes. The point is that CS015 students can draw their complex Cartoon shapes without having to manually position everything with trial and error. Hopefully it leads to prettier Cartoons and more complex logic since they'll have to spend less time making their shapes.
